# PS-IMS Network Insights
Analyzing Packet Switched (PS) core and IMS network data to optimize performance. This project tracks my journey to becoming an IMS specialist with data analytics skills.

## Initial Dataset
- `ps_data.csv`: PS core metrics (throughput, latency).
- `ims_data.csv`: IMS metrics (SIP delay, call status).
